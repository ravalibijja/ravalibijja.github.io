        <center><h2>Best and Most Common Web and Mobile Technologies</h2></center>
<p style="color: rgb(151, 167, 167)">Choosing the right web and mobile technologies is critical for your application. Older technologies may limit the lifespan of your software. Mismatched technologies may not be a good fit for your project, limiting your future performance or functionality.

If you are new to custom software, the number of modern technologies for web and mobile development can be overwhelming.

In this article, we give a brief overview of the different types of technologies and their purposes in creating software.  Then we list the most common technologies for each.</p><br>
<h3><strong>Web Front End</strong></h3>
<p style="color: rgb(139, 145, 145)">The user interface or web front end is the part of the code that you see and interact with. You may hear terms like User Experience or UX. That is the art of creating an application that is easy and intuitive to use.

With regards to the technologies that User Interface developers use to build the web screens, there are primarily three: HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
<h3><strong>HTML</strong></h3>
<p style="color: rgb(137, 146, 146)">HTML stands for HyperText Mark-up Language and provides the structure on the screen. A developer will identify page titles, images, text boxes, buttons, and text with HTML.  The current standard for HTML is HTML5.</p>
<h3><strong>CSS</strong></h3>
<p  style="color: rgb(154, 165, 165)">CSS stands for Custom Style Sheets. The purpose of CSS is to give a uniform look and feel to your web pages. CSS controls the fonts used, text sizes, colors, the position of elements on the page. The current standard for CSS is CSS3.</p>
<h3><strong>Javascript</strong></h3>
<p style="color: rgb(145, 151, 151)">Javascript is a client-side scripting language. It allows your page to do things without contacting the main web server.

Validating the format of an email address is an example. Javascript is really powerful, and there are many Javascript libraries that make web page development much easier. Below are just a few.
